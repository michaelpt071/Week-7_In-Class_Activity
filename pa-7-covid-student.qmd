## Goals for the Activity  

- Use the `dplyr` verbs to transform your data  
- Create new data sets through the joining of data from various sources 
- Use `forcats` to reorder values on a graph for easier comparison  


**THROUGHOUT THE Activity** be sure to follow the Style Guide by doing the following:  

- load the appropriate packages at the beginning of the Quarto document  
- use proper spacing  
- *add labels* to all code chunks  
- comment at least once in each code chunk to describe why you made your coding decisions  
- add appropriate labels to all graphic axes  



## Setup - United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths

Starting in January 2020, the New York Times started reporting on COVID-19 infections in the United States and eventually created a [Githhub Repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/) of the data they used and reported on in their stories (a field called "Data Journalism"). They ended their data collection in March 2023 and switched to just using data from national reporting systems. 

We will use their data to evaluate COVID-19 and how it varied across different states. You can look on the course website instructions for more details on how we prepared the data.  
 

## Part 1: Greatest Number of Cases

First, we need to read in our clean data. 

Note - there may be an error in the code below.

```{r}
#| label: read-clean-covid-cases

cases <- read_csv("data/covid_cases_us.csv")
```


### Which 10 US States/Territories had the most COVID-19 Cases from January 2020-March 2023

We want to identify the states with the most cases (top 10). To do this, we will need to modify our data to find the total number of cases for each state. The code below does this but ***it has errors!*** 

Correct the errors and then assign the resulting data to `state_totals`.  

```{r}
#| label: calculate-totals

state_totals <- cases |> 
  group_by(state) |> 
  summarize(total = sum(cases_daily)) |> 
  ungroup() # this is useful to do after a group_by calculation is complete so you do not continue grouping by those variables 
```


Now use the `states_totals` and identify the top ten states/territories with the most cases between January 2020 and March 2023. Then make a graph ordered by greatest number of cases to least number of cases (Hint: use `forcats` functions to help you).

```{r}
#| label: top-10-states-cases

state_totals %>% 
  arrange(desc(total)) %>% 
  slice_head(n = 10) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = total,
             y = fct_reorder(state,
                             total)))+
  geom_col(aes(fill = state))+
  theme_light()+
  theme(legend.position="none")+
  labs(x = "Total Cases",
       y = "State")
```

### Canvas Quiz Question 1

**Which state had the most COVID-19 cases between January 2020 and March 2023?**

> California had the most COVID-19 cases between January 2020 and March 2023.


### Other Question
**Is this the best way to look at our data? Is looking at just the total number of cases the best way to compare states?**

> We should instead look at the proportion of each state's population which has COVID-19, as a way to normalize for states with vastly different populations.



## Part 2: Updating our Data Source

Hopefully you realized that there is a flaw in our comparison. Many of the states with the most cases are also some of the biggest states in terms of population size! So is there a better way to make comparisons between groups with differing group sizes at baseline? YES! Here are a few options:  

- Calculate the Proportion  
- Calculate the Percentage  
- Calculate a Rate, such as Rate per 100,000 people  


To do any of the above calculations, we would need the population sizes for each state. Here is data from the US Census Bureau on the state estimated population size in 2019. 

Note - there may be an error in the code below.

```{r}
#| label: us-state-population-data
us_pop <- read_csv("data/USpop2019.csv")
```

### Which 10 US States/Territories had the most COVID-19 Cases Relative to Population Size from January 2020-March 2023

Choose one of the above statistics to calculate to make our comparison between states/territories.  Then recreate your graph from above 

```{r}
state_totals |>
  left_join( us_pop, by=c("state" = "NAME")) |> 
  drop_na(estimate) |> 
  mutate(prop = (total/estimate)) |>
  arrange(desc(prop)) |>
  slice_head(n=10) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = prop,
             y = fct_reorder(state,
                             prop)))+
  geom_col(aes(fill = state))+
  theme_light()+
  theme(legend.position="none")+
  labs(x = "Proportions",
       y = "State")
```

```{r}
state_totals |>
  left_join( us_pop, by=c("state" = "NAME")) |> 
  drop_na(estimate) |> 
  mutate(prop = (total/estimate)) %>% 
  arrange(state)
```



### Canvas Quiz Question 2

**Which state had highest number of COVID-19 cases relative to population size between January 2020 and March 2023?**

>Rhode Island had the highest number of Covid cases relative to population sizes between January 2020 and arch 2023.  


### Other Questions
**What are some possible issues with our analysis? Consider the following:**  

- Data sources and reliability of the data  
- Time scale and impact of time    
- 

> It doesn't account for people who got covid multiple times.


**What other questions would you like to try to answer using this data? Would that require other data sources? What information would you need to answer your questions?**

>It would be best if we can look how the proportions have changed over time in each state.
